# CS 457 - Computer Graphics Shaders

Here are all my projects from CS 457 - Computer Graphics Shaders with Dr. Mike Bailey. I learned about the different types of shaders (vertex, tessellation, geometry, fragment, compute..) and implemented a variety of shader tricks.

Check out my pdfs folder to read about my approach to each project!

# Step- and Blended-edged Elliptical Dots

# Noisy Elliptical Dots

# Displacement Mapping, Bump Mapping, and Lighting

# Cube Mapping Reflective and Refractive Bump-mapped Surfaces

# Image Manipulation

# The Dragon Menagerie Project 

In celebration of the Year of the Dragon, everyone got to implement whatever shader they wanted on a dragon OBJ. I made a chromatic aberration shader that gives the dragon a diamondesque look.

# Geometry Shaders

# Final Project - Skin Shader (WIP)
